# Data

This page presents some views of the aggregate data collected about the AI-generated analyses of headlines, broken down by model and by media source. While individual analyses may hit or miss the mark, in the aggregate I think it's easier to understand overall model performance.

Each section includes an explanation of the data collected, the relevant task instructions given to the AI, and some general observations about the results. Data on this page will be updated daily as new analyses are generated.
